#' Calculate Illicit Spending
#'
#' Calculates the spending on illicit tobacco sources. First obtain the market share of
#' illicit tobacco consumption from HMRC tax gap tables for both factory-made and roll-your-own and obtain an
#' estimate for expenditure on illicit sources based on this percentage and the estimated expenditure
#' on duty-paid tobacco. These expenditures are then adjusted for the estimated
#' illicit prices as a fraction of the duty-paid prices (about a half).
#'
#' Prices are obtained from \href{https://www.ashscotland.org.uk/media/850413/28-calculating-the-cost-of-smoking-june-2021.pdf}{ASH Scotland},
#' for. The market share (consumption) figures are taken from the \href{https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/measuring-tax-gaps-tables}{measuring tax gaps tables 2021}.

#' @param price_fm Numeric. Average price of legally sourced cigarettes.
#' @param price_ryo Numeric. Average price of legally sourced HRT/RYO tobacco.
#' @param price_fm_ratio Numeric. The illicit cigarette price as a proportion of legal prices.
#' @param price_ryo_ratio Numeric. The illicit HRT price as a proportion of legal prices.
#' @param illicit_data Data table. Consumption data for illicit sources of tobacco.
#' @param illicit_data_year Numeric. Year of illicit consumption data to use.
