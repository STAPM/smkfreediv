#' Proportion of English Smokers
#'
#' A scalar proportion of total UK smokers that are English. This is used to adjust UK total duty receipts from tobacco
#' to a figure representative for England, in order to feed into the calculation of estimated total expenditure on tobacco
#' in England for the upshift factor to apply to the toolkit data. This approach assumes that spending follows similar patterns
#' across the four UK nations such that expenditures are distributed the same way as are smokers.
#'
#' The proportion is calculated using data on smoking status collected in the Annual Population Survey (APS) from 2011 to 2018.
#' The proportion of UK smokers who are English is calculated separately for each year and averaged across the eight years. The
#' figure is stable at around 82% and statistically not significantly different year on year.
